% slope fields as take home packet and extra examples

Slope Fields has been replaced with a take-home packet and quiz. This content will still be on the unit test but will not reviewed in class!! Link to Packet can be found below (clickable if using PDF version as well). Solutions can be found in the folder at start of book.
