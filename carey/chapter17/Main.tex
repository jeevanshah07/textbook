\subsection*{Implicit Differentiation}
What we have been doing so far is explicit differentiation, as $y$ has always been an explicit function of $x$. Today, we will continue our journey of taking derivatives but now with equations that are not functions!\\
\begin{tcolorbox}[title= STEPS FOR IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION,colframe=black,sharp corners,colback=white,colbacktitle=white,coltitle=black,boxrule=1pt]
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to $x$, doing $x$ as you normally would. The derivative of $y$ becomes $dy/dx$ or $y'$.
        \item Collect terms with $dy/dx$ on one side of the equation.
        \item Factor out the $dy/dx$.
        \item Solve for $dy/dx$.
    \end{enumerate}

Second derivatives of Implicit Functions is a skill that is always exercised on the AP Exam. The level of simplification might vary, but the overall procedure and \textit{form} of the final answer is important.
